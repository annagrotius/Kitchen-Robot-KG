# Intro
This is the Masters thesis project of Anna de Groot. The project investigates the use of structured sources from the web to create a knowledge graph that can provide kitchen-related commonsense information to a kitchen domain robot. After the development of a knowledge graph prototype, it is implemented in a virtual reality game application. 

The project was completed in collaboration with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen (<https://ai.uni-bremen.de/>).
